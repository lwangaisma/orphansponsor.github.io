# Sponsoring Ugandan Orphans Through School

Are you interested in making a difference in the lives of orphans by helping them receive an education? Sponsoring an orphan through school can provide them with the opportunity to learn, grow, and reach their full potential. 

There are many organizations that offer sponsorship programs for orphans. These programs typically provide funding for school fees, uniforms, books, and other educational expenses. Some organizations may also offer additional support, such as mentorship and tutoring. This one is however geared towards offering just school fees. [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/real-gdp-per-capita/country-comparison) has Uganda's GDP per capita at $2,200 which is 211/229 countries in the world. 

### How it works
For just $250 a year, you can sponsor a child's education in Uganda. With this opportunity, you can make a meaningful impact on a child's life without the responsibilities that come with parenting. The children you sponsor will come from families who are able to provide for their basic needs but lack the means to pay for tuition.

As a sponsor, you will receive regular updates on your sponsored child's academic progress throughout the year. These reports will be sent to you via WhatsApp or a link to a Google Drive folder that will be sent to your email. The $250 sponsorship fee can be paid in full annually or in three installments, aligning with the school's academic term fee schedule. We will send you an annual reminder of when the next academic year fee is due.

Here's how the process works:

1.  You make a payment as a sponsor
2.  You will receive a welcome email with the details of the child you are sponsoring
3.  The payment will be sent to the school
4.  We will provide you with the bank slip as proof of payment
5.  At the end of each academic term, we will upload the report to google drive and send the link to you
6.  The process will repeat every year

By choosing to sponsor a child's education, you are giving them the chance to pursue their dreams and build a better future. You will be making a lasting difference in their lives, and we are grateful for your support.

### Minimum -> 0 admin costs
The primary objective of this program is to minimize administrative costs and ensure that every dollar spent goes towards the tuition of the children in the program. Initially, our goal was to have no administrative costs at all. However, upon further examination, we realized that as the program grows and the number of children increases, the logistics and administrative tasks become more complex and costly. As a result, we have decided to allocate 10% of the budget to cover expenses such as transportation of student reports, payment of school fees, verification of attendance, and contingencies in case a sponsor is unable to continue their support for any reason. This will ensure the continuity of the children's education and help to minimize any interruptions.

### Where things are currently
Currently, the process is done manually. An individual is given the money to pay for the student's tuition fees, and then provides a bank receipt as proof of payment. The student is then required to present this receipt on the first day of the academic term. At the end of the term, the individual goes to the school to retrieve the report card that gets sends it to you. 

### Roadmap
As mentioned earlier, the current process is quite manual. In the future, it is desired to have a more streamlined and efficient system in which money is paid directly to the school via credit card or mobile money, and is attributed to the specific student. This will significantly reduce administrative costs, as it will no longer require someone to physically pay the tuition fees. Additionally, an annual report will be produced, detailing all money received and expenses.
